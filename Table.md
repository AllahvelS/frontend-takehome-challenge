| Functional Requirement                                   | How to Build | How to Test |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **1. Fetching the list of users**                        |              |             |
| - Fetch data from the provided external API              | Implemented `fetch` response| Upon checking frontend(via `console.log(data)`), data is confirmed to have been fetched.|
| - Show loading state while the API call is in progress   | Set a loading state to true at the start so that the page would go into loading| Page will briefly say `One Second` to confirm loading|
| - Show error state if the API call returns an error response or if any other error occurs while fetching data. Display the error message returned by the API. |Implemented error state | Throws aand console.log the error message in the event theres an error|
| - Display the list of users                              | create a state for users starting an empty array and setUsers to data| users prop is passed down properly to render content to show the list of users|
| **2. Expand / Collapse user information**                |              |             |
| - Implement a button that toggles visibility of the `about` paragraph for a user. | create a button to handle the toggle feature along with useState | when on browser, clicked the button to show details and clicke again to hide |
| - Implement `Expand All` button to expand all cards      | create a function and button to handle `expandAll`| When button is pressed, all user details open(can still close individual users)             |
| - Implement `Collapse All` button to collapse all cards  | create a function and button to handle `collapseAll`|When button is pressed, all user details close(can still open individual users)             |
| **3. Filter by hobbies**                                 |              |             |
| - Display each user's hobbies below the `Company` section|Add li for hobbies, add hobbies to the destructured object with the variable user,use hobbies.join(", ") to bring all of the hobbies together separated by a comma|Under company, user's hobbies now show as a list             |
| - Generate hobby filter buttons dynamically             | map through hobbies and create buttons for each as an onClick event| All hobby buttons appear on browser             |
| - Implement two states for hobby filter buttons: selected or not selected. |selectedHobbies is an empty array created in `app.js` where when hobby is clicked, its pushed to the list of selectedHobbies,  in `filter.js` selectedHobbies is called and when the function is used(by clicking a button), the hobby is added to the list and the button turns blue( due to css)| Users can see when clicking a hobby button, it highlights blue to confirm it was selected             |
| - Filter users based on selected hobbies and display matching users. |reduce the hobbies array to remove duplicates, and for each hobby that isnt in the new array, push it , this returns the list of hobbies.|filter through the users and return the ones that match the hobbies selected(if user hobbies match hobbies in selectedHobbies list) when clicked, the list of users changes based on the hobbies selected. Only users will *ALL* hobbies will appesr on the list 
| - Display message if no users match selected filters    | Since the users need to have every hobby selected, in the case there are no , matching users, the page will say there are no matching users with selectedHobbies.| Choosing a bunch of hobbies will eventually show the message with there being no matches to the selectedHobbies.|
